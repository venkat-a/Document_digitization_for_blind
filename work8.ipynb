    "Ensemble Prediction Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble prediction combines the predictions of multiple machine learning models to improve accuracy and robustness. Here’s a high-level overview of the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "Models Selection:\n",
    "   - Choose a set of pre-trained models (`final_baseline_model`, `resnet50_model`, `efficientnet_model`) that have been trained on similar or different datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test Data Preparation:\n",
    "   - Use a generator (`test_generator`) to provide batches of test data. This approach is efficient for handling large datasets without loading them entirely into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble Prediction Function:\n",
    "   - Define a function (`ensemble_predict`) that:\n",
    "     - Takes a list of models and a test data generator as input.\n",
    "     - Uses each model to generate predictions (`model.predict(test_generator)`).\n",
    "     - Concatenates these predictions into a matrix (`X`) where each column represents predictions from a different model.\n",
    "     - Retrieves the true class labels (`y`) from the test data generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meta Model (Optional):\n",
    "   - Optionally, a meta-model (e.g., logistic regression) can be trained on the concatenated predictions (`X`) and true labels (`y`) to learn how to best combine the predictions from individual models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Prediction:\n",
    "   - Use the trained meta-model (if applicable) to predict the final class labels for the test data (`y_pred`). Alternatively, directly use the combined predictions for final predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhanced Performance: Ensemble methods leverage diverse models to improve prediction accuracy and generalization, compared to individual models.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Flexibility:Ensemble methods can combine models trained on different architectures or with different hyperparameters, providing a robust solution to complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability:By using generators and efficient prediction methods, ensemble prediction can handle large datasets and complex models efficiently.\n",
